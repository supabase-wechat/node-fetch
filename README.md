# `node-fetch` - [Wechat Miniprogram](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/framework/) compatible

Forked from supabase/node-fetch, the origional documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/supabase/node-fetch).

## Usage

As it serves only as a submodule and workspace dependency in [supabase-wechat/supabase-js], there will be no independent builds out of this repository.

## Major changes

- remove wx incompatible `globalObject.fetch.bind(globalObject)`
